 This is it, 853 qualifying matches, 195 countries playing, 20 million fans watching. The World Cup has come to the boil in Soccer City, Johannesburg. The Netherlands and Spain are left with the chance to proclaim themselves champions of the world in 2010. But Tyson wins yet another header. He's won his battle with David Villa tonight, that's for certain. This one's to the middle. It is Arjen Robben. Is this the moment for the Netherlands? Casillas saves Spain, Robben holds his head in his hands and can't believe he's not now accepting the glory Snider ball was inch perfect to Robben who cut between the two defenders but he couldn get it beyond the trailing leg of the Spanish captain Sergio Ramos and Navas, back to Ramos, tries to fend away Elia. Did that successfully, and Van Persie, with the opportunity to play Robben in! Oh, and Robben, was he pulled back? And for the second time, Arjen Robben is restraited by his own inability to beat Iker Casillas. Well, the arm came across from Puyol without doubt and Casillas was again so quickly off the line. Netherlands-Spain is 0-0 and we have 30 more minutes to play. The Fabregas in it is Cesc Fabregas and just as Robben was foiled at this end of the field earlier by Casillas so Fabregas is foiled by Stecklenburg El Hero Elia. Takes on Ramos, gets between the two, down he goes, no foul. The first time in history. The first time ever Fabregas slides it through and Andres Iniesta blasts it beyond Martin Stecklenburg surely to grab the glory. The Spanish are desperate to hear the final whistle. There it is, Spain are world champions, 2010. Desolation for the Dutch, an absolute ecstasy for the Spanish. The final score was Netherlands 0, Spain 1. Thank you for watching.
